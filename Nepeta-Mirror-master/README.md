     <h4 align="center"><i>Hey! Syns here. Nepeta is back. I had shut this mirror repo back in April, April 1st to be exact. With developers continuing her tweaks, I felt this repo was unnecessary (although some rando decided to continue it). Since she is back, I'm removing all assets from this repository excluding her Git Repo 7-Zip. If she wants even that removed, she can contact me (@truesyns) or Chr0nic (@Chr0nicT) on Twitter. Thanks for your understanding! Welcome back Nepeta - even if it's temporarily.</h4>

  <li> You can now download her GitHub files (open-source files) off the website via this link: https://chr0nict.github.io/Nepeta-Mirror/nepsgit.7z or by simply downloading the file from this repository.</li>
